# Java development resources

This repo includes most of the examples we develop during our lessons. Most of them are coded using Spanish 💃, as its the vehicular language we use. However, it's Java, so almost anybody should be able to understand this code.

Resources are organized in self contained packages, so you don't need anything else to make them work.
